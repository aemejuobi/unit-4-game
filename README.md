# Crystal Collector

# The Crystal Collector game is a game where at the beginning, the user is given a random number between  19 and 120.

# There will also be a display of four crystals, each with its own random number between 1 and 12.

# The objective is to click the crystals and get the sum to equal the random number given at the start of the game.

# If the sum of the crystals clicked equals the target number, you win, the game restarts, and you get a new target random number and the crystals get new random numbers as well. Your wins increment by 1. 

# If you lose, the game restarts with new random numbers given, and your losses increment by 1.
